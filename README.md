### Hello!

I am a self-taught MERN stack developer changing after years of client and customer support and a couple liberal arts degrees. Lately, I've been working in React Native on the frontend and learning about better code architecture. 

Thanks for giving my code a look. Feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to make a new acquaintance or renew an old one.
